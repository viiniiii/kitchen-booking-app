Kitchen Booking App – Suggested Improvements

1.Booking Logic Improvements
- Fix time input to use time slots based on kitchen’s availability.
- Prevent users from booking already-booked hours.
- Disable selection of past times (not just past dates) if booking is for today.
- Add error messages for incomplete forms before allowing confirmation.
- Show booked/unavailable hours when a date is selected.
- Would improve the logical relationships between booking and kitchens
- When creating a booking for a kitchen, I would also add the logic to add the bookings in the booked array of the corresponding kitchen.

2.Calendar and Date Selection
- Sync selected date from <input type="date"> with the calendar component.
- Auto-refresh availability calendar after submitting a booking.
- Allow filtering kitchens by availability in a selected date range (e.g. "show kitchens available this Friday").

3.User Features
- Show upcoming bookings in a "My Bookings" section.
- Send confirmation email after a booking.

4.UI and Design Enhancements
- Show animated success/failure icons after booking confirmation.
- Add pagination and load more kitchens.
- Fix minor responsive design issues.
- Improve the visual design — current layout is a bit plain.
