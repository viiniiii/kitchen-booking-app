Kitchen Booking App – Suggested Improvements

- Fix the time input to use time slots based on kitchen’s available slots for the selected day.
- Prevent user from booking hours that are already booked (show only available time slots for that day).
- When user selects a date via the <input type="date">, synchronize the selected date with the main calendar component.
- After submitting a booking, auto-refresh the availability calendar to show updated slots.
- Disable selection of past times (not just past dates) in the time input if booking is for today.
- Add error messages for incomplete forms (e.g. missing name/email) before allowing confirmation.
- Show booked/unavailable hours for a given day if user clicks on a date.
- Show upcoming bookings for the user (my bookings section).
- Allow user to filter kitchens by date range availability (e.g. "show kitchens available this Friday").
- Send confirmation email on booking.
- Add pagination and add more kitchens.
- Show animated success/failure icons on booking confirmation.
